# Cipher_Machines
Planning out the pseudo code for historical cipher machines and programming them in different languages. A project I plan on doing for fun, so it will be slow going.

### Enigma Machine
The pseudo code works out how the physical machine would translate into OOP code. As of now there is a Python Enigma that does very basic character substitution.
